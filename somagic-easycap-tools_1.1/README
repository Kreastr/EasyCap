Description
-----------
somagic-extract-firmware is a small tool to extract the EasyCAP Somagic
firmware from a Windows driver file. It searches the driver file for the
firmware and verifies its CRC32 signature before writing it to a file.


Preliminaries
-------------
Before using this program, a file must be obtained. Using Wine or
Windows, run "Setup.exe", which should be found in the "Drivers"
directory of the EasyCAP installation CD. This should create a driver
file named "SmiUsbGrabber3C.sys" or "SmiUsbGrabber3E.sys", located in
the "Program Files/Common Files/Somagic/SmiUsbGrabber3C/xp/" or
"Program Files/Common Files/Somagic/SmiUsbGrabber3E/xp/" directory.


Dependencies
------------
make, gcc, libgcrypt11 (and development headers)


Example
-------
sudo somagic-extract-firmware ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/Common\ Files/Somagic/SmiUsbGrabber3C/xp/SmiUsbGrabber3C.sys


To build from sources
---------------------
make && sudo make install


To build Debian source and binary packages
------------------------------------------
apt-get install devscripts debhelper
debuild -us -uc


To clean debian directory
-------------------------

Developer tools
---------------

`somagic-extract-firmware` only extracts firmwares that are known to work for
end-users.  Developers can use `extractor` program to try to extract firmwares
that are not supported yet.

Example of use:

   ./extractor SmiUsbGrabber3C.sys

   Loading file `SmiUsbGrabber3C.sys` (827952 bytes)
   Found firmware at offset 0x11f20 (7812 bytes): somagic_firmware_11f20.bin
     - magic   : d9 00 / 0c 03 
     - checksum: 58 c6 cf 55
   Found firmware at offset 0x13db0 (7812 bytes): somagic_firmware_13db0.bin
     - magic   : d9 00 / 0c 03 
     - checksum: 58 c6 cf 55
   Found firmware at offset 0x15c40 (7812 bytes): somagic_firmware_15c40.bin
     - magic   : d9 00 / 0c 03 
     - checksum: 58 c6 cf 55
   Found firmware at offset 0x17ad0 (7812 bytes): somagic_firmware_17ad0.bin
     - magic   : d9 00 / 0c 03 
     - checksum: 58 c6 cf 55

* `magic` is probably some kind of version. Here it would be 0x0c94d900 (the
  0x0c94 prefix is always the same). The second magic number (0x0c940c03) is
  unused by `somagic-extract-firmware`.
* `checksum` is a CRC32 computed from the extracted firmware.
* the size of the firmware is given in bytes

These 3 values are required to make `somagic-extract-firmware` support more
firmwares.

All the firmwares are extracted in "somagic_firmware_OFFSET.bin" files.

Keep in mind that we don't fully understand .sys file format (firmwares are
stored in the unstructured .data section of these PE files) so `extractor` may
just fail.

Also we don't know why the same firmware (as proved by the size/checksum) is
stored 4 times in the .sys file as shown above.
